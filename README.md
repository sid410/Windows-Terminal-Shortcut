# Windows-Terminal-Shortcut

 Script to easily open Windows Terminal

## How to use

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install Windows PowerToys.
3. In PowerToys Keyboard Manager, remap a shortcut that has an action to open URL. Define the Path/URL as the global path of `silent_launch.vbs`.

### Note

We add the `silent_launch.vbs` to remove the annoying flicker when opening PowerShell to run the batch file.
